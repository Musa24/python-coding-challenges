#### Problem 1

Given a list of words, separated by white-space,
and outputs how many times each word appears in the list.
For example given ["apple","orange","apple","banana"] ,
return { "apple":2, orange:"1","banana":1 }
NB: ignore case sensitivity

#### Problem 2

Given a positive integer greater than 2 as input and write out the number of times
one must repeatedly divide this number by 2 before getting a value less than 2.
For example number = 10 return 3

#### Problem 3

Given a list of numbers, return whether any two sums to k. For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.
